Current list of TODOs:

**Pal List**

- Filters on Pal list page
  - Work Suitability - Should allow for tier 1-4 for each
  - Elements
  - Filter by Map locations
- Sorting system by type, by power (highest to lowest) / low to high, by base use (Work Suitability, etc)

**Pal Page**

- Pals that can only be obtained via breeding should have a note in their summary.

**Items List**

- Filters
  - by Map locations
- Armor, Weapon, blueprint, etc

**Items Page**

- Double check schematics show their stats, cost, and where to get them.
- items should show the path to get them. Ie Carbon Fiber requires either Coal or Charcoal, where Charcoal requires Wood
- Individual Items should be able to show a map of where these items drop. Likely toggle between the Droppers view / map
  - A little more difficult, need to refactor how we place the points. Place one every few pixels rather than allowing them to stack on top of each other so tightly.

**Skills**

- Skills section added
- Active Skills list (and linking)
- Passive Skills list (and linking)
- note what skills can be taught through skill fruits, etc.

**Breeding**

- Breeding section: Select Child outcome and see the parents, or vice versa.
- breeding info seems incorrect. Verify with https://palworld.kimpton.io/?parent1=14.0&parent2=68.0

**Map**

- Map leveling zones. <https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.re>
- Map has dungeons and what bosses might be in them

**Localization**

- Localization for supported languages by Palworld.

**UI Changes**

- (??) Potential "hide pal images" note so folks who want more of the "discovery" aspect of the game don't get spoiled
- "Needs 10 catches" - could be beneficial for users of the app, since you get more xp when you catch 10.

**Data Generators to be added**

- Pal Sizes
- Active / Passive skills
- Unique NPCs (is this even beneficial?)
- Base Objects and their stats
  - Max workers, work suitability and rank required, work type, affects sanity level

**Completed**

- ~~Recipes for items~~
- ~~Add related technology to the pal page~~
